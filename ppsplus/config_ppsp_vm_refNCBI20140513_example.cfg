# BASIC SETTINGS
#
# Ncbi taxon ids only up to this rank, including, (as seen from the superkingdom) will be considered
# (e.g.: 1 ~ phylum, 2 ~ class, 3 ~ order, 4 ~ family, 5 ~ genus, 6 ~ species)
rankIdCut=6
#
# The maximum number of leaf clades (ncbi taxon ids) that will be modelled by PhyloPythiaS
# (max 100 recommended)
maxLeafClades=50
#
# An ncbi taxon id will be considered if at least this percentage of all sample specific data (assigned to leafs
# of the taxonomy) was assigned to it.
minPercentInLeaf=1.0

# Min. length of a sequence/contig/scaffold, shorter sequences won't be considered

#
# ADVANCED SETTINGS
#
# It is not recommended to change the advanced settings, however it is possible to give you more control.
#
# Assign not placed contigs of one scaffold according to the placed contigs of this scaffold,
# when sample specific data is generated based on the marker gene analysis (16S, 23S, 5S, and "31" genes).
# (see also: agThreshold, assignedPartThreshold)
placeContigsFromTheSameScaffold=True
#
# Agreement threshold
# Let us consider that N contigs of a scaffold are placed along a common path from the root R
# down to some low level clade LC. All contigs of the respective scaffold are placed to the lowest
# clade C (that lies on the path from R to LC), s.t., |agThreshold*N| of the contigs are placed
# on the path from C to LC. (default: 0.3-0.5?) (see also: placeContigsFromTheSameScaffold, assignedPartThreshold)
agThreshold=0.3
#
# Let us consider that the sum of all contigs' lengths of a scaffold is L and
# the sum of all assigned contigs' lengths of the scaffold is AL
# if AL/L >= assignedPartThreshold then all not assigned contigs of the scaffold are assigned according
# to the assigned contigs (see also: placeContigsFromTheSameScaffold, agThreshold)
assignedPartThreshold=0.5
#
# Up to this rank (including starting from 0) all ncbi taxon ids (found by the marker gene analysis) will be included
# if there is enough data to model them in the database (see: minGenomesWgs) or
# in the sample specific data (see: minBpToModel)
# (default: set it to 0~superkingdom or 1~phylum since there is often enough data in the sequence database to model them)

# The contigs' names in the reference file must correspond to the contigs' names in the input fasta files
# if this is not the case, you can enter a regexp. where the string in brackets denotes the part of the contig's name
# that will be copied to the (*.PP.pOUT) and (*.pOUT) pipeline output files
# e.g. the contigs' names in the fasta input file are: scaffold[0-9]+_contig[0-9]+
# and the contigs' names in the reference file are: contig[0-9]+
# to mach the names, you can enter: ^scaffold[0-9]+_(contig[0-9]+)
